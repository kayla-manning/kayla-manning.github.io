description: I partnered with Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) to see if they were interested in taking a deeper look at any data they had on hand. They indicated that they had a pile of data with the swipe counts for every day, location, and meal for the undergraduate HUDS facilities over the duration of the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years. After I completed the project, I scheduled a call with the Director of Strategic Initiatives at HUDS to discuss my project and its findings. In my project, I found that dining patterns did shift toward closer dining halls and FlyBy between the two academic years, likely as a result of the increased time pressure at meal times under the new class schedule for the 2018-2019 academic year. Some findings, for example, include that River Central Houses appear to have much higher interhouse traffic compared to River West, and Currier is by far the most popular dining hall in the Quad.
